# INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON # 

**Whats Cool with Python?**
    - It does Normal Things like Math 
    - You can Write Functions with Operators
    - Alphanumerics (duhhhhh)

**Syntax!**
    *[::-1]*
        - Reversal Operator (I Think) {#Reverse}

**Expressions:**
    - You can assign Expressions to Variables `f = max`
        - but not vice-versa `max = f (reassigns Name)`

**Environment Diagrams:**
    *Visualizes the Interpreter's Process*
        - Global Frame: each Name has a set Value
        - Private Frame: within the scope of Functions
