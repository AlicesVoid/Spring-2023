# Jan 25: Software Ch.1 # 

**What is Software**
    - [Instructions], that when executed provide desired functions
    - [Data_Structures] that enable programs to manipulate info
    - [Documentation] that describes program operation and usage
    *What is Software*
        - is Developed/Engineered (not Manufactured)
        - does not "wear out"
        - custom-built (industry moving towards component-based)
    *Software Examples*
        system software
        application software
        engineering/scientific software 
        embedded software 
        product-line software
        WebApps (Web Applications)
        AI software
        *NEW CATEGORIES!*
            - [Cloud_Computing] pervasive, distributed computing
            - [Ubiquitous_Computing] wireless networks
            - [Netsourcing] the Web as a computing engine
            - [Open_Source] "free" source code for anyone rlly-
            - etc: Data Mining, Grid Computing, Cognitive Machines
            - etc2: Software for Nanotechnologies

**Wear vs. Deterioration**
    - Graph of [Failure_Rate] over [Time]
        - Low Rate infers [Changes]
            - [Changes] cause the [Failure_Rate] to Increase

**Legacy Software**
    *Why must it change?*
        - software must be [adapted] to meet new system standards
        - software must be [enhanced] to implement new biz. req.s
        - software must be [extended] to make it [interoperable]
        - software must be [re-architected] to make it viable

**WebApp Characteristics**
    *Network Intensiveness*
        - WebApps reside on a Network, and respond to network influx
    *Concurrency*
        - A large number of users may access the WebApp at one time
    *Unpredictable Load*
        - The number of users on WebApp changes very frequently
    *Performance*
        - WebApp users expect app usage to take a reasonable amt. time
    *Availability*
        - WebApps often demand "24/7/365 Service" & monitoring
    *Data Driven*
        - Primary Function of WebApps is to send Data to a Hypermedia
    *Content Sensitive*
        - Content Quality/Aesthetic determine overall WebApp Quality
    *Continuous Evolution*
        - WebApps evolve continuously and can be quickly modified
    *Immediacy*
        - WebApps exhibit a Time to Market that changes biz. outcome
    *Security*
        - It is difficult/impossible to limit user pop. on a WebApp
    *Aesthetics*
        - Undeniably, a large appeal on WebApps is the Aeshetic UI

**Software Engineering**
    - is the establishment and use of [Sound_Engineering_Principles] in order to obtain [economically] software that is [reliable_and_works_efficiently] on [real_machines]
    *Sound Engineering Principles*
        1. concerted effort should be made to understand problem before starting to complete the problem
        2. design becomes a pivotal activity
        3. software should exhibit high quality
        4. software should be maintainable

**A Process Framework**
    *FIRST: Framework Activities*
        - Sequentially Accomplished Communication
        - Planning 
        - Modeling 
            - Analysis of Requirements
            - Design
        - Construction
            - Code Generation
            - Testing
        - Deployment
            - Maintenance (if Necessary)
    *SECOND: Umbrella Activities*
        - Consistently Applied/Updated when Applicable: 
            - Software Project Management 
            - Formal Technichal Reviews
            - Software Quality Assurance
            - Software Config. Management
            - Work Product Prep. and Prod. 
            - Reusability Management
            - Measurement
            - Risk Management

**Adapting a Process Model**
    - overall flow of Activites, Actions, and Tasks 
        - also their Interdependencies duh
    - the degree to which actions/tasks are defined in a [Framework]
    - the degree to which work products are identified/required
    - the manner in which Quality Assurance activities are applied
    - the manner in which Project Tracking  activities are applied
    - the manner in which Control           activities are applied
    - the overall degree of detail/rigor used to describe the process
    - the degree to which customers/stakeholders are involved in proj.
    - the level of autonomy given to the software team 
    - the degree to which team organization and roles are prescribed

**The Essence of Practice**
    *1. Understand the Problem*
        - who has a stake in the problem?
        - what are the unknowns?
        - can the problem be compartmentalized?
        - can the problem be represented graphically?
    *2. Plan the Solutuon*
        - have you seen similar problems before?
        - has a similar problem ever been solved?
        - can subproblems be defined?
        - can you represent a solution in an effective implementation?
    *3. Carry Out the Plan*
        - does the solution conform to the plan?
        - is each component part of the solution provably correct?
    *4. Examine the Result*
        - is it possible to test each component part of the solution?
        - does the solution produce results that conform to the req.s?
            - necessary data, functions, and features that are req.d

**Hooker's General Principles**
    1. The Reason It All Exists
    2. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
    3. Maintain the Vision
    4. What You Produce, Others Will Consume
    5. Be Open to the Future
    6. Plan Ahead for Reuse
    7. Think!

**How it all Starts**
    *Safehome:*
        - Every software project is precipitated by some biz. need--
            - the need to correct a defect in an existing app
            - the need to adapt 'legacy systems' to new environments
            - the need to extend functions/features of a system
            - the need to create a new product, service, or system
