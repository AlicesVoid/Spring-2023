## CH 35: RISK ANAL. ##

**Risks**
    - What can go Wrong? and,
    - What can we do about it?
    *Reactive Risk Management*
        - React to Risks as they happen
        - Plan to mitigate resource-use in problem solving 
        - Fix on Failure 
        - Crisis Management
    *Proactive Risk Management*
        - Formal Risk Analysis Performed:
            - examine root causes of risks 
            - examine external risk sources
            - examine methods to solve possible risks
    *Risk-Management Principles*
        1. Maintain a global perspective
        2. Take a forward-looking view
        3. Encourage open communication
        4. Integrate
        5. Emphasize a Continuous Process
        6. Develop a Shared Product Vision
        7. Encourage Teamwork
    *Risk Identification: Find Risks Here*
        1. Product Size 
        2. Business Impact
        3. Customer Characteristics
        4. Process Definition
        5. Development Environment
        6. Technology to be Built ("newness")
        7. Staff Size and Experience
    *QUESTIONS TO ASK* : `Ch.35 pg.8-9`

**Risk Projection**
    - Project your Risk into a Quantifiable Graph
    *Risk Components*
        - Performance Risk 
        - Cost Risk 
        - Support Risk 
        - Schedule Risk 
    *Risk Estimation (Projection)*
        1. Establish a Scale that reflects the percieved risk chance
        2. Delineate the consequences of the risk
        3. Estimate the Impact of the risk on the project & product
        4. Note overall accuracies to mitigate misunderstandings
        [METHOD:]
            Risk Col. | Probability | Impact | RMMM 
            ---------------------------------------
            item i    |   _ %       | 1-to-5 | how_to_solve
        `Risk Exposure:`
            RE = P x C  (probability x cost-to-project)
    *NOTE: Fancy Words*
        [mitigation] - how to avoid risk?
        [monitoring] - how to make risk less likely?
        [management] - what is our risk contingency plan?

**Notable Risks: (Ch.35 pg. 17-22)**
    1. Due to Product Size 
    2. Due to Business Impact 
    3. Risks Due to the Customer
    4. Risks Due to Process Maturity
    5. Technology Risks
    6. Staff/People Risks
